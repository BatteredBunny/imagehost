# Imagehost

## Using docker-compose.yml

If using s3 (This of course works with backblaze B2 also) copy example_s3.json to config.json and fill out the fields
else copy example_local.json to config.json and fill out the fields

## Without docker

There's a handy build script, it puts assets and binary into bin/build.tar.gz
you still have to fill out config.json
